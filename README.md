**Architect:** Volodymyr Shevchenko | CTO @ Fayna Digital

### 🌐 Overview
This repository demonstrates a professional Python-based bridge between industrial printing machinery and **Odoo Enterprise MRP**. It ensures seamless data flow from the production floor to the boardroom.



### 🛠 System Components
* **`config.py`**: Secure abstraction layer for API credentials.
* **`machine_tester.py`**: Connectivity & Heartbeat validation module (Ensures machines are "listening").
* **`main.py`**: Central execution engine for real-time synchronization.

### 🚀 Business Value
* **Eliminate Manual Entry:** Real-time production counts directly in Odoo.
* **Predictive Maintenance:** Monitor machine status via API to prevent downtime.
* **Scalability:** Ready for integration with hundreds of machines via MQTT/REST.
